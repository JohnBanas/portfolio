    <!--About Me-->
    <section class="flex-parent-divide border">
      <h2 id="about-me" class="child2">About Me</h2>
      <p class="child2"><strong>Welcome to my page!</strong><br/>I live and work in Nashville,TN with my wife Samantha and our puppy Teddy. 
        I enjoy travelling both locally and globally, so be sure visit my 
        Facebook or Instagram for pictures of some of my adventures! I believe 
        strongly in helping others and being of service. Technology is in the unique position to give a lot of resources
        efficiently to the world. I want to be part of that solution.<br/><br/>
        I began a coding journey over a year ago while helping my nephew with his computer science homework.
        I have twenty years of management experience in the service industry, so I excel in customer service and problem solving.
        I thouroughly enjoy the creative yet technical aspects of software development.  I love to work with a team, but can be self-managed 
        when necessary. I am a self-motivated learner who can adapt to new concepts quickly. I have front and back end software engineering
        skills that I am happy to put to work for you! You will find examples below in the "Projects" section. Feel free to reach out with any questions, or just to chat!
